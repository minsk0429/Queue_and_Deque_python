Data structures implemented in Python (Queue and Deque)

# Queue in Data Structures

## ðŸ“‹ Queue

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a line of people waiting â€” the person who comes first is served first.

---

## Characteristics
- Follows **FIFO** order  
- Insertion (`enqueue`) happens at the **rear (end)**  
- Deletion (`dequeue`) happens at the **front (beginning)**  
- Supports:
  - `enqueue`: add an element to the rear  
  - `dequeue`: remove the element from the front  
  - `peek` or `front`: view the front element without removing it  
  - `is_empty`: check if the queue is empty  

---

## Example (Python)

```python
from collections import deque

queue = deque()

# Enqueue elements
queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')

# Peek front element
print(queue[0])  # Output: a

# Dequeue element
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: a
print(queue)            # Output: deque(['b', 'c'])
```
---

## Use Cases

- Task scheduling and management
- Handling requests in servers (e.g., print queue)
- Breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs and trees
- Buffering and asynchronous data transfer

---

# Deque in Data Structures

## ðŸ“‹ Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

A **deque** is a generalized queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends (front and rear). It combines features of stacks and queues.

---

## Characteristics

- Supports insertion and deletion at both front and rear
- Can function as both FIFO queue and LIFO stack
- Supports:
- append: add to rear
- appendleft: add to front
- pop: remove from rear
- popleft: remove from front
- is_empty: check if empty

---

## Example (Python)

```python
from collections import deque

deque_obj = deque()

# Add elements to rear and front
deque_obj.append('x')
deque_obj.appendleft('y')

print(deque_obj)  # Output: deque(['y', 'x'])

# Remove elements from front and rear
print(deque_obj.popleft())  # Output: y
print(deque_obj.pop())      # Output: x
print(deque_obj)            # Output: deque([])
```

---

## Use Cases

- Implementing both stack and queue functionalities
- Undo/redo operations where elements are added/removed at both ends
- Palindrome checking
- Sliding window algorithms
